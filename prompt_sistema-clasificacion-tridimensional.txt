## 1. 📝 INPUT PROCESSING GUIDELINES

### 🔍 CRITICAL MULTIPLE SENTENCE DETECTION RULES (Enhanced v18.1)

**PRIORITY ORDER FOR SENTENCE DETECTION:**

1. **PUNCTUATION SEPARATORS** (Highest Priority)
   - Periods (.), exclamation marks (!), question marks (?)
   - Example: "Soy de Madrid. Me gusta bailar." → TWO sentences

2. **LINE BREAKS AND FORMATTING**
   - Line breaks (\n), multiple spaces (2+)
   - Example: "Engineer\nMusic lover\nFoodie" → THREE sentences

3. **CAPITALIZATION PATTERN DETECTION** ⚠️ NEW RULE ⚠️
   - ANY word starting with capital letter creates a new sentence (with or without prior separator)
   - Example: "madrid Doctor Music" → THREE sentences ("madrid", "Doctor", "Music")
   - Example: "soy médico Amante del fútbol" → TWO sentences ("soy médico", "Amante del fútbol")
   - Exception: First word of biography doesn't count as separator

4. **EMOJI SEPARATORS**
   - Emojis automatically function as sentence delimiters when no periods exist
   - Standalone emojis are complete sentences: "❤️" = one sentence
   - Topic-change emojis: "🇪🇸 Engineer 🎵 Music lover" → THREE sentences
   - Professional/activity emojis: "👨‍💻", "🏋️‍♂️", "🎸", "⚽" → Each creates new sentence

5. **BULLET POINTS AND DASHES**
   - Dashes (-), bullets (•), multiple hyphens
   - Example: "Madrid - Gym - Coffee ☕" → THREE sentences

6. **TOPIC CHANGE INDICATORS**
   - Clear shifts in subject matter (location → profession → hobbies)
   - Age/physical + profession: "25 años Médico" → TWO sentences
   - Location + activity: "🇪🇸 Football" → TWO sentences

**ENHANCED EXAMPLES:**

✅ **Multiple Sentences Detected:**
- "I from Venezuela 🇻🇪 Profesional" → TWO sentences (emoji + capitalization)
- "madrid Doctor Music" → THREE sentences (capitalization pattern)
- "Engineer 👨‍💻 Dog lover 🐕 Foodie 🍕" → THREE sentences (emoji separators)
- "25 años\nMédico\nAmante del fútbol" → THREE sentences (line breaks)
- "Soy ingeniero Me gusta viajar" → TWO sentences (capitalization: "Me")
- "estudiante Trabajo en madrid" → TWO sentences (capitalization: "Trabajo")
- "🇪🇸 Spanish 🎵 Music 🏋️‍♂️ Gym" → FOUR sentences (emoji + topic changes)

✅ **Detection Priority Rules:**
- **When in doubt, prefer MULTIPLE sentences over single**
- **Capitalization after lowercase = NEW sentence** (key rule)
- **Each distinct topic/idea = separate sentence**
- **Professional + personal info = separate sentences**
- **Age/physical + other info = separate sentences**

✅ **Processing Guidelines:**
- Input text may consist of one or more sentences
- Each sentence is classified individually across all three dimensions
- Emojis have dual functionality: separators AND semantic content
- Final output consolidates all sentence classifications using " | " format

## 2. 🔍 CLASSIFICATION DIMENSIONS OVERVIEW

The three dimensions used for classification:

1. **SENSE** - Classifies the sentence's level of subjectivity and semantic content
   - Consensual (Objective): Facts, roles, groups, activities
   - Subconsensual (Subjective): Self-attributions, evaluations, opinions

2. **REFERENCE** - Identifies objective nominal elements describing identity
   - Noun phrases with objective meaning (excluding pronoun "I")
   - Example: "I am 22" → Age (Reference subcategory)

3. **ATTRIBUTE** - **DICHOTOMOUS VERSION**: Simple presence/absence of evaluative qualifiers
   - "Yes": Contains evaluative qualifiers describing self-perception
   - "No": Does not contain evaluative qualifiers

**IMPORTANT CLASSIFICATION RULES:**
- A sentence can have multiple REFERENCES but only ONE ATTRIBUTE classification (Yes/No)
- A sentence can only have ONE SENSE category (the most probable)
- **ALL SENTENCES MUST HAVE A SENSE** - if unclear, default to "Global" (consensual) for generic statements or "Subconsensual" for unclear identity content
- Attribution is now dichotomous: "Yes" or "No"
- Reference is now dichotomous: "Anclaje", "Sin anclaje", or "No" when not applicable

---

## 3. 🧠 SENSE CATEGORIES

### I.1 CONSENSUAL (OBJECTIVE)
Objective statements that can be verified or are widely recognized by society, including physical characteristics, social roles, activities, possessions, narratives, and universal human descriptions.

📌 *Key Examples*: 
- Physical: "Height 1.90m", "I wear glasses", "I am 22 years old"
- Groupal/Collective: "I am a mechanic", "I am Catholic", "Student at the institute", "🇪🇦"
- Activity: "I am a smoker", "On weekends I go out partying", "I play football"
- Property: "I have a dog", "I have a house on the beach"
- Narrative: "I have dedicated myself to my family", "I got married very young"
- **Global consensual**: "A human being", "Just another person", "Member of a society", "Someone like everyone else"
- **Sexual Identity**: "Man", "Woman", "Trans", "Non-binary" (consensual and has anchor)

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION - Global vs Test Evasion:**
- **Global (CONSENSUAL)**: Meaningful statements about universal human condition or broad identity categories
  * Examples: "A human being", "Person with feelings", "Member of society", "Someone like everyone else"
  * These have actual semantic content about identity
- **Test Evasion (SUBCONSENSUAL)**: Attempts to avoid answering or deflect the question
  * Examples: "What time is it?", "Enough with so many questions", "I don't want to answer", "This is boring"
  * These are responses that don't engage with identity classification

### I.2 SUBCONSENSUAL (SUBJECTIVE)
Subjective statements involving personal evaluations, opinions, preferences, beliefs, aspirations, self-doubt, metaphors, references to others, or attempts to evade the task.

📌 *Key Examples*:
- Self-assessment: "I am intelligent", "I am skillful", "I am nice/friendly", "I am good", "I am handsome", "I am tired"
- Self-esteem: "I am happy with myself", "I am the best", "I love my life"
- Preference: "I like living in the city", "Passionate about motorcycles"
- Beliefs: "I think the world can change", "I believe in equality"
- Aspirations: "I would like to work", "My dream is to be a bullfighter"
- Self-doubt: "I don't know who I am", "I often wonder who I am"
- Nihilistic/Undefined: "Nothing", "I am nobody", "I am insignificant in a big world"
- About others: "My father is a teacher", "My dog's name is Boby"
- **Test evasion**: "What time is it?", "Enough with so many questions", "I don't want to answer", "This is stupid"
- Metaphor: "I am the moon", "I am the king of the house"
- **Activities/Physical aspects without context**: "Running", "Tall", "Strong" (when isolated without clear purpose)

---

## 4. 📚 REFERENCE CATEGORIES

### II.1 SIN ANCLAJE (WITHOUT ANCHOR)
References to identity elements not tied to specific social contexts or relationships.

**Biosocial (II.1)**
References to biological and personal identity markers.
📌 *Key Examples*: "@Chiqui", "Jacobo Sánchez" (Name), "Female", "Man", "Girl" (Gender), "19 years old", "Young", "Thirty years old" (Age), "Tall", "Glasses", "Bald", "Freckles" (Physical Characteristics), "Celiac", "Diabetic" (Health identity)

**Generic (II.6)**
Universal terms or broad categories.
📌 *Key Examples*: "Human being", "It's me" (Universal definition), "Someone", "People", "A piece of matter" (Material partitive), "Member of a society", "Person with feelings" (Social partitive)

### II.2 ANCLAJE (WITH ANCHOR)
References to identity elements tied to specific social contexts, relationships, or institutions.

**Groupal/Collective (II.2)**
References to specific groups, professions, or institutions.
📌 *Key Examples*: "Engineer", "Student", "Catholic", "Member of the club", "Madridista", "Volunteer", "Professional"

**Relational (II.3)**
References to interpersonal relationships.
📌 *Key Examples*: "Father", "Mother", "Friend", "Partner", "Neighbor", "Colleague"

**Spatial (II.4)**
References to specific geographical or institutional locations.
📌 *Key Examples*: "From Madrid", "Spanish", "Lives in Barcelona", "University student", "Works at Microsoft"

**Linguistic (II.5)**
References to specific languages or communication skills.
📌 *Key Examples*: "Speaks English", "Learning French", "Bilingual", "Native Spanish speaker"

**Activity/Location-based (II.7)**
Activities and physical locations that represent social anchoring.
📌 *Key Examples*: 
- **Activities with purpose/context**: "Playing football ⚽", "Studying medicine 📚", "Working as chef 👨‍🍳", "Fitness training 🏋️‍♂️"
- **Physical locations**: "Country flags 🇪🇸🇺🇸", "Cities 🏙️", "Specific places 🏖️🏔️"
- **Activity emojis representing social roles**: "👨‍💻" (programmer), "👨‍⚕️" (doctor), "🎨" (artist)
- **ALL HOBBIES/ACTIVITIES/AFICIONES**: "Football", "Reading", "Music", "Cooking", "Gaming", "Dancing", "Photography", "Cycling", "Swimming" (ALWAYS Anclaje even without context)

## 5. ✨ ATTRIBUTE CATEGORIES (III) - DICHOTOMOUS VERSION

### NEW v18: SIMPLIFIED DICHOTOMOUS ATTRIBUTION

Instead of multiple attribute categories, use only:

### III.1 "Yes" - ATTRIBUTION PRESENT
The sentence contains evaluative qualifiers, adjectives, or descriptors that express:
- Personality traits, values, and moral characteristics
- Emotional states and feelings  
- Social skills and interpersonal characteristics
- Practical skills, economic status, and material capabilities
- Physical appearance and aesthetic qualities
- Any subjective evaluation or qualifier

📌 *Examples that get "Yes"*:
- "I am intelligent" (intellectual evaluation)
- "I am handsome" (aesthetic evaluation)
- "I am friendly" (social evaluation)
- "I am rich" (economic evaluation)
- "I am happy" (emotional evaluation)
- "I am responsible" (moral evaluation)
- "I am tall" (physical qualifier when used evaluatively)

### III.2 "No" - NO ATTRIBUTION
The sentence contains only objective references without evaluative qualifiers:
- Pure factual statements
- Role or group memberships without qualifiers
- Activities without evaluative descriptors
- Neutral objective descriptions

📌 *Examples that get "No"*:
- "Engineer" (just the profession)
- "Student" (just the role)
- "Football" (just the activity)
- "I am 25 years old" (just factual age)
- "I live in Madrid" (just location)
- "Human being" (universal category)

---

## 6. ❓ AMBIGUOUS CASES GUIDE

**Use "No" for REFERENCE when:**
- No clear category applies for Reference
- Information is insufficient for Reference
- The sentence doesn't contain reference information
- Test evasion statements

**NEVER use "NA" for SENSE, REFERENCE, or ATTRIBUTION - every sentence must have:**
- SENSE: Either "Consensual" or "Subconsensual"
- REFERENCE: Either "Anclaje", "Sin anclaje", or "No"
- ATTRIBUTION: Either "Yes" or "No"

**Priority Rules:**
1. **SENSE**: MANDATORY classification - if unclear, use "Consensual" for generic/objective content, "Subconsensual" for unclear personal content
2. **REFERENCE**: Most specific category wins (Anclaje > Sin anclaje > No)
3. **ATTRIBUTION**: Dichotomous - "Yes" if ANY evaluative qualifier present, "No" if purely objective

---

## 7. 🔥 ENHANCED CLASSIFICATION RULES 

### 🚨 MANDATORY MULTIPLE SENTENCE DETECTION (v18.1)

**BEFORE CLASSIFYING, ALWAYS APPLY THESE DETECTION RULES:**

1. **SCAN FOR CAPITALIZATION PATTERNS**
   - Look for capital letters after lowercase letters
   - Each capital letter (except first word) = new sentence boundary
   - Examples to detect:
     * "madrid Doctor" → "madrid" + "Doctor" (2 sentences)
     * "ingeniero Amante del deporte" → "ingeniero" + "Amante del deporte" (2 sentences)
     * "25 Me gusta bailar" → "25" + "Me gusta bailar" (2 sentences)

2. **SCAN FOR EMOJI BOUNDARIES**
   - Each emoji can be a sentence separator
   - Professional emojis (👨‍💻, 👨‍⚕️, 🎨) = new sentence
   - Country flags (🇪🇸, 🇺🇸, 🇻🇪) = new sentence
   - Activity emojis (⚽, 🎵, 🏋️‍♂️) = new sentence

3. **SCAN FOR TOPIC SHIFTS**
   - Age → Profession: "25 años Médico"
   - Location → Activity: "Madrid Football"
   - Physical → Hobby: "1,79 Music lover"
   - Profession → Personal: "Engineer Dog lover"

4. **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: FAVOR SEPARATION**
   - When uncertain between 1 or 2+ sentences → Choose MULTIPLE
   - Better to over-separate than under-separate
   - Each meaningful unit = separate sentence

**DETECTION EXAMPLES WITH STEP-BY-STEP:**

📝 **Input**: "I from Venezuela 🇻🇪 Profesional"
🔍 **Detection**: 
- Emoji 🇻🇪 = separator
- Capital "P" in "Profesional" after emoji = new sentence
- **Result**: THREE sentences: "I from Venezuela" + "🇻🇪" + "Profesional"

📝 **Input**: "madrid Doctor Music"
🔍 **Detection**:
- "madrid" (lowercase) → "Doctor" (capital) = sentence boundary
- "Doctor" → "Music" (capital) = sentence boundary  
- **Result**: THREE sentences: "madrid" + "Doctor" + "Music"

📝 **Input**: "25 años Me gusta viajar"
🔍 **Detection**:
- "años" (lowercase) → "Me" (capital) = sentence boundary
- **Result**: TWO sentences: "25 años" + "Me gusta viajar"

📝 **Input**: "Engineer 👨‍💻 Dog lover 🐕 Foodie 🍕"
🔍 **Detection**:
- Each emoji creates sentence boundary
- **Result**: THREE sentences: "Engineer 👨‍💻" + "Dog lover 🐕" + "Foodie 🍕"

### ENHANCED SENSE RULES
- **ALL sentences MUST have a SENSE** - never leave undefined
- **ALL ACTIVITIES/HOBBIES/AFICIONES**: ALWAYS "Subconsensual" with "Anclaje" reference
  * Examples: "Football", "Reading", "Music", "Cooking", "Gaming", "Dancing", "Photography" → ALL Subconsensual + Anclaje
  * This applies even to single words without additional context
- **Sexual Identity**: Always "Consensual" with "Anclaje" (social anchor)
- **Physical locations/Countries**: Always have "Anclaje" (geographical/cultural anchor)
- **Generic activities without context**: "Subconsensual" (unclear purpose)
- **Emoji-only sentences**: Analyze semantic meaning for social anchoring

### CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Global vs Test Evasion:
- **Global statements (CONSENSUAL)**: Meaningful universal identity descriptors
  * "Human being", "Person", "Someone like everyone", "Member of society"
  * These convey actual semantic meaning about human identity
  * Classification: CONSENSUAL with appropriate reference category
- **Test evasion (SUBCONSENSUAL)**: Attempts to avoid or deflect the identity question
  * "What time is it?", "I don't want to answer", "This is boring", "Enough questions"
  * These do not engage with identity content and try to change the subject
  * Classification: SUBCONSENSUAL with reference="NA" and attribution="No"

### ENHANCED REFERENCE RULES
- **ALL HOBBIES/ACTIVITIES/AFICIONES**: ALWAYS "Anclaje" (social anchoring through activity participation)
- **Location-based references**: "Anclaje" for countries, cities, specific places
- **Sexual identity references**: "Anclaje" (socially anchored identity)
- **Physical aspects without context**: "Sin anclaje" (no social context)
- **Global human descriptors**: "Sin anclaje" (universal, not socially anchored)
- **Test evasion**: "No" (no identity reference provided)
- **Unclear or insufficient information**: "No" (default when no clear reference category applies)

### NEW v18: DICHOTOMOUS ATTRIBUTION RULES
- **"Yes"**: ANY evaluative qualifier, adjective, or subjective descriptor present
  * "I am intelligent", "I am tall" (when evaluative), "I am happy", "I am good"
- **"No"**: Pure objective statements without evaluative qualifiers
  * "Engineer", "Student", "Football", "25 years old", "Human being"
- **Default for ambiguous cases**: "No" (conservative approach - requires clear evaluative qualifier for "Yes")

---

## 8. 🎯 CONDITIONAL LOGIC RULES 

### CRITICAL: SENSE-BASED CONDITIONAL ATTRIBUTION

**RULE 1: Subconsensual Sentences - Attribution Evaluation**
- If SENSE = "Subconsensual" → Evaluate for evaluative qualifiers
- Look for adjectives, evaluative descriptors, or subjective qualifiers
- If present → Attribution = "Yes"
- If absent → Attribution = "No"
- Example: "Football" → SUBCONSENSUAL + Attribution = "No" (no evaluative qualifier)
- Example: "I am good at football" → SUBCONSENSUAL + Attribution = "Yes" (evaluative qualifier "good")

**RULE 2: Consensual Sentences - Attribution Evaluation**
- If SENSE = "Consensual" → Evaluate for evaluative qualifiers
- Consensual statements can still have evaluative aspects
- If evaluative qualifier present → Attribution = "Yes"
- If purely objective → Attribution = "No"
- Example: "Engineer" → CONSENSUAL + Attribution = "No" (objective role)
- Example: "I am a good engineer" → CONSENSUAL + Attribution = "Yes" (evaluative qualifier "good")

**RULE 3: Test Evasion Exception**
- Test evasion statements get Attribution = "No" (no identity evaluation)
- These correctly use "No" for reference and "No" for attribution

### APPLICATION PRIORITY:
1. First classify SENSE normally
2. Then evaluate for presence of evaluative qualifiers
3. Attribution = "Yes" if ANY evaluative qualifier present, "No" otherwise
4. Respect exceptions for test evasion

```json
{
  "sense": "Consensual" | "Subconsensual",
  "reference": "Anclaje" | "Sin anclaje" | "No",
  "attribution": "Yes" | "No"
}
```

  ],
  "summary": {
    "sense": "Consensual | Subconsensual",
    "reference": "Anclaje",
    "attribution": "Yes"
  }
}
```

**NEW PIPE FORMAT FOR OUTPUT (RECOMMENDED):**
For each input, provide three strings:
- SENSE: All sense categories for each sentence, separated by " | "
- REFERENCE: All reference categories for each sentence, separated by " | "
- ATTRIBUTION: All attribution categories for each sentence, separated by " | "

**ENHANCED EXAMPLES WITH NEW DETECTION RULES (v18.1):**

📝 **Input**: "Engineer 👨‍💻 Dog lover 🐕 Foodie 🍕"
🔍 **Detection**: THREE sentences (emoji separators)
📤 **Output**:
SENSE: "Consensual | Subconsensual | Subconsensual"
REFERENCE: "Anclaje | Anclaje | Anclaje"
ATTRIBUTION: "No | No | No"

📝 **Input**: "madrid Doctor Music"
🔍 **Detection**: THREE sentences (capitalization pattern: "madrid" + "Doctor" + "Music")
📤 **Output**:
SENSE: "Consensual | Consensual | Subconsensual"
REFERENCE: "Anclaje | Anclaje | Anclaje"
ATTRIBUTION: "No | No | No"

📝 **Input**: "I from Venezuela 🇻🇪 Profesional"
🔍 **Detection**: THREE sentences ("I from Venezuela" + "🇻🇪" + "Profesional")
📤 **Output**:
SENSE: "Consensual | Consensual | Consensual"
REFERENCE: "Anclaje | Anclaje | Anclaje"
ATTRIBUTION: "No | No | No"

📝 **Input**: "25 años Me gusta viajar"
🔍 **Detection**: TWO sentences (capitalization: "25 años" + "Me gusta viajar")
📤 **Output**:
SENSE: "Consensual | Subconsensual"
REFERENCE: "Sin anclaje | Anclaje"
ATTRIBUTION: "No | No"

📝 **Input**: "estudiante Trabajo en madrid Amante del fútbol"
🔍 **Detection**: THREE sentences (capitalization: "estudiante" + "Trabajo en madrid" + "Amante del fútbol")
📤 **Output**:
SENSE: "Consensual | Consensual | Subconsensual"
REFERENCE: "Anclaje | Anclaje | Anclaje"
ATTRIBUTION: "No | No | No"

📝 **Input**: "I am intelligent. I am happy. I am a student."
🔍 **Detection**: THREE sentences (period separators)
📤 **Output**:
SENSE: "Subconsensual | Subconsensual | Consensual"
REFERENCE: "Sin anclaje | Sin anclaje | Anclaje"
ATTRIBUTION: "Yes | Yes | No"

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR MULTIPLE SENTENCE DETECTION:**
⚠️ **ALWAYS scan for capitalization patterns first**
⚠️ **Each capital letter after lowercase = new sentence boundary**
⚠️ **When in doubt, choose MULTIPLE sentences over single**
⚠️ **Apply detection rules BEFORE classification**
⚠️ **Better to over-separate than under-separate**

Always use this format for multi-sentence inputs. If the input is a single sentence, the output will be a single value for each category.

**Examples with v18 Dichotomous Attribution Rules**:

**Input**: "Football"
**Output** (hobby rule + no evaluative qualifier):
```json
{
  "sense": "Subconsensual",
  "reference": "Anclaje",
  "attribution": "No"
}
```

**Input**: "Good at football"
**Output** (hobby rule + evaluative qualifier "good"):
```json
{
  "sense": "Subconsensual",
  "reference": "Anclaje",
  "attribution": "Yes"
}
```

**Input**: "Engineer"
**Output** (consensual role + no evaluative qualifier):
```json
{
  "sense": "Consensual",
  "reference": "Anclaje",
  "attribution": "No"
}
```

**Input**: "Excellent engineer"
**Output** (consensual role + evaluative qualifier "excellent"):
```json
{
  "sense": "Consensual",
  "reference": "Anclaje",
  "attribution": "Yes"
}
```

**Input**: "I am tall"
**Output** (subconsensual + evaluative qualifier):
```json
{
  "sense": "Subconsensual",
  "reference": "Sin anclaje",
  "attribution": "Yes"
}
```

**Input**: "I am 25 years old"
**Output** (consensual age + no evaluative qualifier):
```json
{
  "sense": "Consensual",
  "reference": "Sin anclaje",
  "attribution": "No"
}
```

**Input**: "A human being"
**Output** (global statement + no evaluative qualifier):
```json
{
  "sense": "Consensual",
  "reference": "Sin anclaje",
  "attribution": "No"
}
```

**Input**: "What time is it?"
**Output** (test evasion exception):
```json
{
  "sense": "Subconsensual",
  "reference": "No",
  "attribution": "No"
}
```

**CLASSIFICATION REMINDERS**
- ALL sentences → Must have "Yes" or "No" attribution (never NA)
- ALL sentences → Must have "Anclaje", "Sin anclaje", or "No" reference (never NA)
- Attribution = "Yes" only when evaluative qualifiers are present
- Attribution = "No" for purely objective statements
- Reference = "No" when no clear identity reference is present
- Apply dichotomous logic consistently
- Look for adjectives, evaluative descriptors, subjective qualifiers for "Yes"
- ALL hobbies/activities → Subconsensual + Anclaje + attribution
- Subconsensual sentences → Must have attribution (never NA)
- Consensual sentences → Must have reference (never NA unless no reference present)
- Apply conditional logic after normal classification
- Use defaults only when absolutely necessary

🚨 **MANDATORY PRE-PROCESSING CHECKLIST (v18.1):**
✅ **STEP 1**: Scan input for capitalization patterns (lowercase → Uppercase = new sentence)
✅ **STEP 2**: Identify emoji separators and topic changes  
✅ **STEP 3**: Count total sentences detected
✅ **STEP 4**: If multiple sentences detected, use " | " format in output
✅ **STEP 5**: When uncertain, favor MULTIPLE sentences over single
✅ **STEP 6**: Apply classification rules to each sentence separately

Remember to apply ALL enhanced rules consistently, especially the new dichotomous attribution system and **MANDATORY multiple sentence detection rules**. **EVERY SENTENCE MUST HAVE ATTRIBUTION CLASSIFIED AS "Yes" OR "No" AND REFERENCE AS "Anclaje", "Sin anclaje", OR "No".**

⚠️ **FINAL WARNING**: Failure to detect multiple sentences when they exist is a critical error. Always prioritize sentence separation over unification.
